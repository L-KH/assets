# MetaGame Assets

This repository is for the requesting of art/design work, and the collection of some of the assets post-production.

## How to Contribute

Submit a [pull request](//github.com/MetaFam/assets/pulls) which creates a directory for yourself under `artists/` with whatever filesystem structure you desire.

## Contributing Via the Web

It is possible to use Github's web interface to add yourself a directory and populate it with art:

## Preferred Format

If at all possible, that asset should:

* be stored as a SVG
* open with a `svg` element whose `width` and `height` are `100%` and has an appropriate `viewBox`
